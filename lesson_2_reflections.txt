what happens when you initialize
a repository? why do you need
to do it?
when i initialize a repository,
i think it creates a folder
for the commits to live in.
i'm guessing this needs
to happen so that the commits have 
a place to be saved to.

how is the staging area different
from the working directory and
the repository? what value do you
think it offers?
the staging area id different
from the working directory
because you take files from the
working directory and put them into
the staging area. you could have
files in your staging area that
are not in your working directory.
